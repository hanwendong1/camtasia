As part of the GEER grant, the University of Idaho has secured a license to use TechSmithâ€™s Camtasia software for both Windows and MacOS computers for three years starting 1/25/2021. Camtasia is a screen capture and video editing tool that lets you record, edit, and share your videos. This web resource is created for University of Idaho faculty and staff who assist in the creation of instructional material for courses. Please feel free to [contact the workshop facilitator](mailto:hanwendong@uidaho.edu) if you have any questions about this website or Camtasia.
