## Edit Zoom/Teams lecture recordings

## Record a PowerPoint slide show with narration
This add-in is only available for Windows operating system and is automatically installed after you installed Camtasia. It allows you to record your PowerPoint slides with narration. 
After completing the recording, click `Stop recording`, save the file, and then choose either `Produce your recording` to export the recording to mp4 format or `Edit your recording`. If you choose the latter option, you can drag the recording from the media bin to the timeline in Camtasia for additional editing. The screen recording and the camera recording will appear on separate tracks. The blue clip markers indicate new slides on the screen recording track. You can rename the markers, especially if you are publishing the video to YouTube where the markers’ titles can be served as YouTube video chapter titles. 
You can not only reposition and resize the camera recording but also create a custom mask for a circled talking head effect. To create a mask, go to `Annotations`, choose a circle shape, drag it on top of the screen recording track, cover the speaker’s face, and extend the duration to match the screen recording track. Then right-click the camera recording track’s eyeball icon and choose `alpha`. Then, select both clips, right click and choose group, and right click the shape track’s eyeball icon and choose none.
