## Saving as a Local File
To export a video as a local file, navigate to `Export`, then choose `Local File…` and select, and choose `MP4 only (up to 720P)` or `MP4 only (up to 1080P)` as the standard option. 
If the video contains interactivity such as hotspots and quizzes, there is a specific process for exporting to ensure that the final video would retain its functionality. Navigate to `Export`, then choose `Local File…` and select one of the options with `MP4 with Smart Player`.
## Sharing to YouTube
If you added markers on the timeline, you can check the *Create table of contents from markers* box to generate chapters for the final YouTube video.
