To create your own materials using `workshop-template-b`, please create a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you do not have one already.
Basic familiarity with the GitHub web interface will be helpful.

For a quick introduction check out GitHub's [Hello World guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), or the extensive [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/).

It is possible to create a website with this template using only GitHub's web interface--in fact, it works great!
However, for more advanced uses you will want Git, Ruby, and Jekyll installed on your computer to do local development.
