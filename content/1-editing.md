To **import media**, click `+` in the `media bin` or click the `import media…` button. You can then drag the imported media to the timeline to start editing.

To **remove unwanted parts**, you can make a cut by using slice, trim, or ripple techniques. 
- To trim the beginning or the end of a clip, drag either end of the clip towards the middle of the clip. 
- To split a clip in half, move the playhead to where you want to make the cut, then press the `split` button.
- To remove a portion of the clip and close the empty gap, drag the green and red blocks next to the playhead to choose a selection, then right click on the portion of the clip to be removed and choose `ripple delete`. Alternatively, click the `enable magnetic tracks` button with the magnet icon to automatically close all the gaps as you edit.

Click the eyeball icon to **disable a track**, and click it again to re-enable it. Clicking the eyeball icon while holding `Alt` on your keyboard would solo the selected the track and disable the other tracks.

To **preview a video**, move the playhead to where you want to preview, then click the play button or press enter on your keyboard.

In addition to importing media from the `media bin`, you can also drag other types of media from the `tools panel` onto the timeline. Here are some common effects from the tools panel that you can add or apply to your video clip:
- **Annotations: A combination of text and graphic overlays.** You can add texts, shapes, blurs and highlights, etc. If adding a highlight, make sure to adjust the position of the clip on your timeline to match the action that you want to highlight.
- **Transitions: To connect different clips for a more polished look.** To apply a transition to a clip, drag the desirable transition to the timeline, and the clips that be applied a transition will highlight in yellow at the beginning and the end of each clip. Release your mouse to one end of a clip to apply the transition to that end or to the middle of the clip to apply the transition to the entire clip. 
- **Noise reduction: To reduce the noise of a clip if the recording picked up any noise sources such as room tone or computer fan.** To apply noise removal, navigate to `Audio Effects` in the tools panel, then drag `Noise Removal` to the track that you want to apply noise removal to. You can also choose to adjust the `Gain`, `Sensitivity`, and `Amount` under `Properties`.
- To draw viewer’s attention, use the scale up the cursor function under `Properties`, `Sketch Motion Callouts` in `Annotations`, `Blur` in `Annotations` and the `Invert` function under `Properties`, or `Spotlight`.

You can add additional media to separate tracks and reorder the tracks. The media in tracks on top of other tracks will appear on top of the other.
