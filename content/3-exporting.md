Save your project early and save it often. Navigate to `File`, then choose `Save` or `Save As…`.

## Saving as a Local File

To export a video as a local file, navigate to `Export`, then choose `Local File…` and choose `MP4 only (up to 720P)` or `MP4 only (up to 1080P)` as the standard option. For more configuration options, choose `Custom production settings`.

If the video contains interactivity such as hotspots and quizzes, exporting requires a specific process to ensure that the final video would retain the functionalities. Navigate to `Export`, then choose `Local File…`, select one of the options with `MP4 with Smart Player` and make sure that the `Report quiz results using SCORM` box is checked.

## Sharing to YouTube
To upload a video to YouTube, navigate to `Export`, then choose `YouTube…`. Once you sign in, you can add a title and a description. If you added markers on the timeline, you can check the `Create table of contents from markers` box to generate automatic chapters based on the markers for the final YouTube video. If you want to publish to YouTube but don't have a google account or only have a personal account, I recommend create a google account for work purposes.

## Other Sharing/Exporting Options

In addition to saving as a local file and sharing to YouTube, you can also choose to navigate to menu, then select `Export` to export image, audio, or caption files locally. 
-	`Export Frame As…` to save the currently selected frame at your playhead’s position as an image
-	`Export Audio Only…` to save the entire project as an audio file
-	`Export Captions…` to save the captioned file in either .srt or .smi format. Note that this option is only available if you have added captions to your project. 

## Archiving Your Project
To archive your project in case that you need to revisit it in the future, navigate to `File`, `Export`, `Zipped Project…`. Rename the file to indicate that it’s an archived version, then click `Save`.
